Bug Fix: Resolving the Input Unfocusing Issue


The Problem
During the development of the form builder, a subtle but critical bug was encountered: all text input fields would lose focus after a single character was typed. This forced the user to click back into the input field to continue typing.

Root Cause
The issue was a classic "re-render and lose focus" bug in React. The initial code used a single, large component (FormBuilder.jsx) to manage all the form's state. When an input field's onChange event updated the parent component's state, it triggered a complete re-render of the entire component tree. This process of re-rendering was causing the browser to unmount and re-mount the input element, which resulted in the loss of focus.

The Solution
      The bug was fixed by applying a key principle of component-based architecture: isolating state and rendering.

  The large FormBuilder.jsx component was refactored into smaller, more focused components. For example, the CategorizeBuilder logic was moved into its own file. This separation had two key benefits:

  Isolated State: The input fields within CategorizeBuilder are now tied to a localized state, preventing the entire parent component from re-rendering on every keystroke.

  Controlled Re-renders: A robust pattern was implemented where the parent state is only updated on specific events, such as when the user finishes typing in a field (onBlur). This ensures a smooth typing experience while still maintaining data integrity.

  This fix not only resolved the bug but also significantly improved the code's readability and maintainability, demonstrating a clean and scalable project structure.
